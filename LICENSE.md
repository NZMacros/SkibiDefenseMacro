# Skibi Defense Macro License (SDML)

**Version 3.0.4**  
Copyright © 2025 NZ Macros (NegativeZero Macros)  
GitHub: [https://github.com/NZMacros](https://github.com/NZMacros)

## Preamble
This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of "Skibi Defense Macro" (the "Software"), an open-source tool developed specifically for Skibi Defense, a ROBLOX experience created by Archkos Studios. The Software is owned by NZ Macros (NegativeZero Macros) and is released under this license.

The Software is designed to enhance the user experience within Skibi Defense by automating specific gameplay actions. It is made freely available to users under the terms outlined in this license. By using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to comply with all the terms stated here. If you disagree with any of the terms, you should not use or distribute the Software.

This Software complies with ROBLOX's guidelines and the specific rules of Skibi Defense, with express permission from a staff member of Archkos Studios to develop and distribute this tool. Please note that the Software is designed solely for Windows Operating Systems, as it is written in AutoHotkey, which is only compatible with Windows.

Additionally, in alignment with seasonal themes, the name of the macro will automatically adjust to reflect the current month or season. For example:
- **September to November**: The macro will be named "Skibi Cursed Macro," in reference to the Halloween season and the "cursed" theme often associated with Skibi Defense during this period.
- **December to February**: The macro will be named "Skibi Jolly Macro," celebrating the "jolly" spirit of Christmas and New Year's.
- **March to May**: The macro will be named "Skibi Easter Macro," in recognition of the Easter holiday.
- **June to August**: The macro will simply retain its original name, "Skibi Defense Macro."

Additionally, the macro's icon will change to fit the theme of the respective season or holiday, though the underlying functionality remains unchanged.
