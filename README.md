<h2>Information:</h2>
This repository is a complete copy of the main repo but is also up-to-date with the latest updates of the macro I make upon saving.
This means it will have the latest things im working on available for testing, however that does not mean releases are stable or work efficiently.<br>
If anything is missing (e.g. issues as small as me forgetting to update the VersionID to a new version/the version I'm working on to as big as a completely busted function) or not working please create an issue thread in this repository.
Note: Commits may not have descriptions and no tags or releases will be created as there is no point in doing so except with more stable releases in the original repo [https://github.com/NegativeZero01/skibi-defense-macro]
