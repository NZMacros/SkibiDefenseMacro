<h2>Information:</h2>
This is the main repository for SDM's<sup><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup> development, where stable and polished releases are posted for you guys.<p>
SDM is an automated tool for SD<sup><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup> (on ROBLOX) for easy AFK<sup><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup> credits/shard (or other currencies) grinding. SDM aims to be easily usuable with a fail-safe program behind it to make it simple to set up and reliable for long-periods of time.<br>
With SDM, you can leave your device running to auto-grind SD while you're busy doing something more... productive (because lets be real, nobody wants to sit at a screen for hours on end, wasting their life away on a video game).<br>
This is a solo-built project, meaning there were no directive code contributions or permanent contributors to this macro and is all made by <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/1198320993958117458">me</a>.
